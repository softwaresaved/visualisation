## How to add new maps

1.   Install Geospatial Data Abstraction Library.

     For Linux:

     ~~~
     $ sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
     ~~~

     For OS X:

     ~~~
     $ sudo brew install gdal
     ~~~

2.   Download the shape file that you need.
     You can find good shape files that are free to use at
     http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/.

3.   Unzip the file that you downloaded. You will end up with a `.shp` file.

4.   Filter the file to just have the information that you want.
     For example, to a map with UK and Ireland you can use

     ~~~
     $ ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -where "iso_a3 IN ('GBR', 'IRL')" output-file.json input-file.shp
     ~~~
