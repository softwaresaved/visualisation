# Implementation details

## Python scripts

Scripts prefixed with `download`:

* These scripts download Google Sheets, using OAuth2 for authentication, then filter the data using Python and save the resultant data as CSV.
* For more on the Google Sheets and OAuth2 APIs used, see:
  - [Introduction to the Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts)
  - Google Sheets API v4 [Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python)
* Data that is saved as-is without filtering, is saved into data/sheets/as-is/.
* Filtered data is saved into data/sheets/filtered/.

Scripts prefixed with `filter`:

* These scripts filter data held locally within the data/raw/as-is.
* Filtered data is saved into data/raw/filtered/.

Other scripts:

* Utilities used by the foregoing.
